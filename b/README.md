# Final-Coding-Compare-human-s-weight-with-animals-
Project idea：My final idea of this project was to show the comparison between human and animals on their weights.
I follow the principle of seesaw to visualise the result. I collected five common animals to compare their weights 
with the human’s. You can add the animal on the seesaw to see how many animals’ weight is equal to one human through 
clicking continuously the left button of your mouse. Of course, you also can check how much human’s weight is equal 
to one bull. I think this project is a good start for us to know the animals and nature.

Challenges and Difficulties: In start, the biggest difficult was to let the seesaw follow the real physical principle. 
Only when the left side’s weight is bigger than the others’, the seesaw starts to move, not move one by one. Therefore, 
I explored more technology methods to realize it. I sat one angel, 30 degrees, and compare the weight of left and right. 
When one side is higher than the others’, the seesaw moves to the 30 degrees or -30 degrees. And when the weight of right 
and left is same, the seesaw moves to balance.
The biggest challenge was to draw the animals on the top and on the seesaw. Because I have to put many animals on the 
seesaw. Finally, I found a method to draw animals and used loop statement to transfer this function.
